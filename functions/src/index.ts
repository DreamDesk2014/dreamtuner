// The Cloud Functions for Firebase SDK to create Cloud Functions and triggers.
// import {onRequest} from "firebase-functions/v2/https"; // Removed - not used here
// import * as logger from "firebase-functions/logger"; // Removed - not used here

// The Firebase Admin SDK to access Firestore.
// If you need to access Firestore from your Cloud Function, you would import admin like this:
// import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';
// admin.initializeApp();
// export const db = admin.firestore();

// Placeholder for your actual Cloud Functions logic.
// Your Next.js API routes are handled by App Hosting, so you typically
// don't write separate http functions here unless you have specific
// Firebase-only backend logic.

// Example of a simple HTTP function if you wanted one (currently commented out)
/*
export const helloWorld = onRequest((request, response) => {
  logger.info("Hello logs!", {structuredData: true});
  response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});
*/

// If you plan to use Firebase Functions for anything else (e.g., triggers, specific backend tasks),
// you would add your functions here. Otherwise, this file can remain minimal.

// IMPORTANT: Your Next.js API routes in `src/app/api/...` are served by Firebase App Hosting.
// This `functions/src/index.ts` file is typically for *additional* Firebase Functions,
// not directly for your Next.js API routes themselves.
// If you only selected "Functions" because you thought Next.js API routes needed it,
// and you don't have other backend logic, you might consider removing the "functions" feature
// from firebase.json if this becomes too problematic and App Hosting handles everything.

// For now, we are making this file compile.
